# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 4th, 7:00pm
 * Where: Online via Discord

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

- We started with an arrangement of 3 people on the frontend, 3 people on the backend. We focused on perfecting the frontend component to look like a completed product first, while the backend team gradually builds up the backend components. The reason for this was because we felt like Deliverable 2 only needed the product to be an MVP, and the frontend is the first component the client interacts with, so it needs to be fleshed out first. This decision was successful because our frontend component was completed very well, and the client was happy with the progress we showed them.
- After completing the frontend component, we gradually moved personnel to the backend to help out with functionalities. The reason for this was because as the frontend component was finished and only needed to be polished, we don't need a full team of 3 people so Brandon volunteered to move to the backend first, then Mohit came after. This decision was successful because the backend functionalities were fleshed out by Mohit and integrated with the frontend.
 


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

- The backend team did not fully plan out the backend classes needed to implement the functionalities. This caused a confusion in which classes needed to be implemented, how they depended on each other, and what their functionalities were. The backend team should have used a UML diagram to plan out the backend.
- The backend team did not discuss the possibility of a database. This caused a confusion in what types of data needs to be stored, and how it should be stored.
- The backend team did not agree on what external APIs to use. We split up the information the functionalities needed to collect from the external APIs, and assigned it to different people. In the end, we did not reach a conclusion on what external APIs needed to be used, and we need to finalize them. 

#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

- The backend team will make a UML diagram to have a consistent model of classes in the backend. This will make implementing the classes and functionalities much clearer and dissolve any confusions about classes.
- The backend team needs to finalize what external APIs to call on to retrieve the information on the backend. We need to finalize this list to send to the client so that we can discuss pricing and subscription.
- Both teams should discuss the possibility of a database. Specifically which database service to use, what information to store, etc. Ensure that a database is in line with what the client desires. 

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * We set up a meeting time on March 1 at 9pm, and 4 of the team members were together in person to demo the product through an online meeting with the client. We deployed the app locally, and shared screens with the client to show them the product and its features.
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * We demoed the deployed desktop app, its UI features and all the possible functionalities that it could perform. Specifically, the functionalities that the client requested, and additional features that we thought were useful to the client.
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Our partner liked our UI and features, and stated that we were in really good progress.
 * Were there change requests?
 * There were change requests to some of the information displayed by a functionality. The client also saw that we were in good progress, and actually was requesting additional functionalities as extra features.
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * There needs to be more careful planning before execution. Poor planning from the backend team caused confusion down the line, and needs to be addressed in the following phase.
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
